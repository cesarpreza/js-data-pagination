# js-data-pagination

A simple data filtering app using HTML CSS and Javascript

# How to use

- use the pagination buttons at the bottom of the page to switch between pages of student data

- Use the search bar at the top of the page to filter students by first name.

# Summary

This filtering application was a tough but encouraging project to build bigger projects. Overall I learned how to add pagination to a webpage and dynamically add/remove data and have the application respond with the correct number of pages.
